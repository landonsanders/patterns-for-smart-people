* [Object](https://github.com/landonsanders/javascript-patterns.github.io/tree/master/object)
* [Function](https://github.com/landonsanders/javascript-patterns.github.io/tree/master/function)
* [Creation](https://github.com/landonsanders/javascript-patterns.github.io/tree/master/creation)
* [Reuse](https://github.com/landonsanders/javascript-patterns.github.io/tree/master/reuse)
